# Olympic_Dataset_EDA_Analysis

## Problem Statement:
Perform a EDA analysis on the given dataset to gain some insight.

### Data Description:
The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). The columns are:

ID - Unique number for each athlete
Name - Athlete's name
Sex - M or F
Age - Integer
Height - In centimeters
Weight - In kilograms
Team - Team name
NOC - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
Games - Year and season
Year - Integer
Season - Summer or Winter
City - Host city
Sport - Sport
Event - Event
Medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA

#### Project Goals:

1. Import the required libraries: Start by importing essential Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

2. Dataset Cleaning: The dataset might contain inconsistencies, duplicates, or missing values.
   The cleaning phase involves:
   Identifying and handling duplicates.
   Handling missing or null values through imputation or removal.
   Ensuring data consistency and integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is the core of this project, where you will uncover insights and patterns in the Olympic dataset.

The key steps involved in the EDA process include:

3. Descriptive statistics: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., for relevant columns.
  
4. Data visualization: Create various visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to better understand the data. Visualizations can help identify trends, outliers, and correlations.
 
5. Time series analysis: Explore how Olympic participation and performance have evolved over time.

6. Country-wise analysis: Analyze the performance of different countries, identifying top-performing nations, and trends in their Olympic history.
Athlete analysis: Investigate athlete-specific trends, such as age distribution, gender distribution, and the success of athletes from different countries.

7. Sport-specific analysis: Examine the popularity of different sports, changes in the number of events, and performance trends.
